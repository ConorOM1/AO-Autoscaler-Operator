# AO-Autoscaler
A Kubernetes Operator designed to automate the scaling of a deployment on a cluster.
## Description
The operator is configured to scale based on the following metrics; Minimum Replicas, Maximum Replicas, CPU Utilisation and Manual Replicas Override. Use an instance of the 'Autoscaler' CR to automate your scaling requirements.
## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes or Openshift cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Autoscaler Custom Resource

`TargetDeploymentName:` Is the name of the Deployment that the Autoscaler will manage. This field is not optional

`MinReplicas:` (Optional) Is the minimum number of replicas that the Autoscaler can scale down to. This field is optional.

`MaxReplicas:` Is the maximum number of replicas that the Autoscaler can scale up to. This field is not optional.

`TargetCPUUtilizationPercentage:` (Optional) Is the target average CPU utilization (as a percentage) over all of the pods. If the average CPU utilization exceeds this threshold, the Autoscaler will scale up. This field is optional

`ManualReplicasOverride:` (Optional) Is used to manually set the number of desired pods. If set, this will supersede the other replica fields. This field is optional.

`Autoscaler Sample CR` can be viewed [Here](config/samples/scaling_v1alpha1_autoscaler.yaml)

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ao-autoscaler:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ao-autoscaler:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
